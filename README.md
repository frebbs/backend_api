# Node.js App with PostgreSQL, Redis, and a Basic Server

This project sets up a development environment for a Node.js application using Docker Compose. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines services for PostgreSQL and Redis databases, and the application includes a basic JSON request-response server.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Node.js
- npm

## Setup

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-nodejs-app.git
cd my-nodejs-app
```

### Step 2: Start the Database Containers

Navigate to the project directory where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the PostgreSQL and Redis containers in detached mode.

### Step 3: Install Node.js Dependencies

In the project directory, install the required Node.js packages:

```bash
npm install
```

### Step 4: Run the Node.js Server

Run your server using the following command:

```bash
node app.js
```

You should see the message `Server running on http://localhost:3000/` in your terminal.

### Step 5: Verify the Containers and Server Are Running

To verify that the containers are running, execute:

```bash
docker-compose ps
```

You should see both the PostgreSQL and Redis containers listed.

To test the server, navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your web browser. You should receive a JSON response with the message `Hello, world!`.

## Configuration

### Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` file contains configurations for the following services:

#### PostgreSQL

- **Image**: `postgres:13`
- **Environment Variables**:
  - `POSTGRES_USER`: `myuser`
  - `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: `mypassword`
  - `POSTGRES_DB`: `mydatabase`
- **Ports**: `5432:5432`
- **Volumes**: `postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data`

#### Redis

- **Image**: `redis:6`
- **Ports**: `6379:6379`
- **Volumes**: `redis_data:/data`

### Node.js Server

The server is set up using Express and listens on port 3000. It includes a basic GET route that responds with a JSON object.

## Volumes

The following named volumes are defined to persist data:

- `postgres_data`: For PostgreSQL data
- `redis_data`: For Redis data
